(For more detail, search for TODO in R source files)

Critical
---------

* Fix bugs when running model for multiple seasons

* Add ability to export raster files from "Pop TS" tab and csv tables of non-spatial data (e.g. total population and cost)

* Precalculate geometry when first-species carrying capacity is included instead of when "Run model" button is pressed (avoids calculating lapmat, gradmat.x and gradmat.y EVERY TIME)

* Add more relevant cost-benefit models (e.g. animal welfare, condition of priority areas)

* More flexible management options (e.g. separate budgeting and timing of different strategies)


Important
---------

* Streamline use of R objects, in particular avoiding use of global variables where possible while avoiding copying of large variables into function calls

* Either fix non-sparse matrix method or remove; currently not working

* Check up on current optimisers

* Allow optimising over multiple management strategies

* Write up more detailed SPADE manual

* Clean up inst/extdata/formulae.csv to include only reasonable and widespread model formulae


Incidental (could potentially leave for post-release)
----------

* Formalise use of first-species carrying capacity as a template, i.e. check every new GIS layer against it and clear all layer data if it is changed

* Clean up code, e.g. clean up TODO statements in R source files

* Clean up function help files (and add for new ones)

* Add population scale on 'Proportional population' graph

* Add optimisers for absolute and proportional removal

* Add Lagrange-multipliers approach for cost-benefit models

* Add two-way interactions between species

* Allow associated cost for demographic/interaction effects

* Allow other projections than GDA94/MGA55
