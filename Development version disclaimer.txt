The Landscapes and Policy Research Hub is collaborating with Parks Victoria and NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a new tool to assist cost-effective decision-making for invasive species management. 

The new tool is called SPADE (Spatial Population Abundance Dynamics Engine) and uses information on the current and potential abundance of a species (for example, deer or wild horses), across a specified landscape (for example, the Australian Alps or the Tasmanian Midlands), combined with relevant information about species demography, (for example, breeding and mortality) to calculate a spatially-explicit estimate (for example, a map or graph) of the species’ abundance over time. 

You have been given access to a development version of the model as an opportunity to test drive the new tool and provide feedback to the developer.

The tool allows users to explore the impacts and costs of different management intervention strategies. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other decision-making tools and processes, and should not be relied on in isolation. Users of the model must independently verify the suitability of the results for their purposes.

Developed by Dr Nick Beeton (Nicholas.Beeton@utas.edu.au), Research Fellow, School of Biological Sciences,  University of Tasmania

The development of the tool was made possible through funding from the Australian Government’s National Environmental Research Program.
